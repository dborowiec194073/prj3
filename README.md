# Honest Headlines

Step into the digital detective's shoes with Honest Headlines! In a world filled with misinformation, Honest Headlines is your go-to tool to separate the real news from the fakes.

**Goal:** Implement a method to classify a news headline as real or fake.

## Using Copilot as the Driver

**Step 1:** Enter this prompt in the chat to prime Copilot to act as the driver:

> Can you act as a pair programmer for me while I work on this project? I'd like you to act as the driver while I act as the navigator. You will suggest code a few lines at a time and also explain what the code does. I will keep track of the bigger picture and check your code to make sure itâ€™s doing what we want it to do.

**Step 2:** Write your code to complete the program. Every **1-2 minutes**, check in with Copilot like you would if your driver was one of your peers. For example, you could:

   * Have it decompose the problem into steps
   * Prompt Copilot for code for a specific step and enter it into your editor
   * Provide feedback to Copilot on code that it generated to improve the solution or suggest a different way to write the code
   * Suggest fixes to Copilot for any syntax or logic errors
   * Make sure that the code it suggests will solve the problem

Either as you go or after you are done writing your program, answer the following questions to reflect your experience using Copilot as the driver.

**What did Copilot do well as the driver?**

Copilot did fairly well, it very quickly generated solution snippets and they worked for the most part

**What did Copilot struggle with as the driver?**

Copilot failed to explain or even vocalize the code context changes it wanted (it possibly missed them). One instance of this was it writing snippets centered around a variable that it didnt specify/define 

**What challenges did you face while working with Copilot as the driver?**

At times it hallucinated the need for changes, for instance it tried to get me to modify the vbox when I instructed it to generate steps of what to do, so critical thinking and oversight is necessary and you cant just let it do what it wants.
